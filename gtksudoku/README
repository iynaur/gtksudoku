GTK Sudoku: A Logic Puzzle Solving Aid

A Sodoku logic puzzle is solved by filling each cell in a board so
that every row, column, and 3x3 square contains the digits one through
nine.  This program eliminates much of the drudgery of solving a
puzzle and provides educational tips should the path to the solution
become obscured.

This program requires GTK+ 2.0 version 2.8.0 or higher.
