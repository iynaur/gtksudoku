GTK Sudoku NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

* Changes in 0.5

** New command: new pushes the current board and then creates a blank one.

* Changes in 0.4

** This version corrects a printing bug exercised when an inconsistent
board is created.  Inconsistent boards occur when one uses trial and
error to solve a puzzle.

* Changes in 0.3

** Advanced strategies and some pair strategies used to determine cells
that had only one possible value (singletons) as a result of applying
the strategy.  In this version, these strategies only perform one
step, and users must identify cells determined by these strategies.

** The propagate all singletons (p) command now ensures no singletons
are left after it is applied.

** The "help details", "help normal", and "index" commands now work as
expected.  In previous versions, the commands were not recognized.

** The text that makes up various help messages have been expanded.

* Changes in 0.2

** Lua License was added to the license text in the help about dialog.

* Changes in 0.1

** Each window has an icon that shows part of a Sudoku board.
