Here is how I built an installer that contains its own version of the
GTK+ runtime on Windows with MSYS.  I uninstalled GTK+, deleted the
GTK directory in Common Files, and then installed GTK+ 2.8.18.  I
copied all the files in the GTK\2.0 directory into a staging area.  I
added my license to the root directory of the staging area, and added
my application to the bin directory.

Next I created a list of the files in the staging directory with:

$ find . -type f | sed 's-\./--g' | sed 's-/-\\-g' > ../files.txt

and a list of the directories with:

$ find . -type d | sed 's-^\.-$INSTDIR-g' | sed 's-/-\\-g' | sort -r \
  > ../dirs.txt

To generate the NSIS input required to create directories and files, I
used:

$ awk '{print "SetOutPath \"" $0 "\""}' dirs.txt

$ awk '{print "File \"/oname=" $0 "\" \"" $0 "\""}' files.txt

To generate the NSIS input required to delete files and directories, I
used:

$ awk '{print "Delete \"$INSTDIR\\" $0 "\""}' files.txt

$ awk '{print "RMDir \"" $0 "\""}' dirs.txt

A little cutting and pasting finished off the revised installer
script, and I was able to generate an installer with its own GTK+
libraries.

Finally, I uninstalled GTK+ 2.8.18, and reinstalled the version used
by GAIM.  There may be some typo in the above, as I'm capturing the
procedure after the fact.
