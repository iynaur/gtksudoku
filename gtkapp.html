D. Ramsdell</a> describes cross-platform GTK+ application development
from a newcomers perspective.</p>

<h1>Cross-Platform GTK+ Applications: A Newcomers Perspective</h1>

<p>Partially in an effort to sharpen my programming skills, I wrote a game
using a GUI framework with which I was not previously familiar, and ported it
to several platforms. The framework selected was <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">The GIMP Toolkit</a>, and the application was a
puzzle solving aid called <a href="http://luaforge.net/projects/gtksudoku">GTK Sudoku</a>. This article
describes my experience, focusing on the lessons learned that I hope will be
of use to other newcomers.</p>

<p>The criteria for selecting a GUI framework were four in number. (1) The
framework had to support cross-platform development. (2) The framework had to
be one that I have never used, otherwise, I wouldn't learn as much. This
eliminated <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a> and <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>. (3) For my tastes, C is
preferred over C++. (4) GTK Sudoku was to be scalable in the sense that size
of the default font determines the size of each window and widget, not the
resolution of the display. The Cairo vector graphics library was of great
help meeting this criterion.</p>

<p>A Sodoku logic puzzle is solved by filling each cell in a board so that
every row, column, and 3x3 square contains the digits one through nine. GTK
Sudoku eliminates much of the drudgery of solving a puzzle and provides
educational tips should the path to the solution become obscured. It is
different from most other programs in this category, because users specify
the rule that justifies each change to the Sudoku board. The program will
fail to apply a rule if its preconditions are not met, thus detecting silly
mistakes early.</p>

<p>Before I list the lessons learned from this project, let me set the
context. GTK Sudoku was constructed by wrapping a GUI around a formerly
text-based application, written as a <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>
script. Lua is a lightweight, easily embeddable scripting language that is
popular with game developers. The Lua interpreter is also available as a
stand-alone program, and users can interact with scripts using a
read-eval-print loop. I've been using and tinkering with my Lua Sudoku script
for over a year, but there aren't too many other people who are willing to
type Lua function calls into a command-line interpreter for each game
interaction. The addition of a GUI was required if wanted to share my take on
this game.</p>

<p>Embedding the Lua script was quick and easy. It was naturally encapsulated
in a C module that exports four functions and imports three. The major change
to the Lua script was the addition of a help system, which was unnecessary
when I was the only user.</p>

<p>The only tricky section of the GUI was the part that displays the board. A
Sudoku board is a 9x9 array of cells grouped into 3x3 squares. In the
preferred way of presenting a board, a line is drawn on each edge of a cell,
and the boundaries of the 3x3 squares are drawn with thicker lines to
distinguish them from the other cell boundaries.</p>

<p>The board is implemented as a widget that extends a GtkTable, and provides a
9x9 table of cells. Each cell is a widget that extends a GtkDrawingArea. The
board widget ensures there is no space between the cell widgets, and that
each cell has the same size. Cairo is used to make each cell dynamically
resizable, and to draw the boundary lines seen by the user. The boundary
lines drawn by each cell depends on the position. Alternatives had to be
explored before this solution was found.</p>

<p>GTK Sudoku was developed on GNU/Linux with Emacs. I had trouble finding
documentation on versions of GTK+ that include Cairo. There were three steps
that resolved this issue. (1) I found, and carefully studied Davyd Madeley's
<a href="http://gnomejournal.org/article/34/writing-a-widget-using-cairo-and-gtk28">article</a>
on writing widgets using Cairo. (2) I bookmarked and frequently referred to
the HTML documents in <code>/usr/share/gtk-doc/html</code>. (3) The key step
was to expand the three source tarballs that make up GTK+, and create an
Emacs tags file for all the C source and header files. I found the
sources adhere to a consistent style, which helps one navigate them.</p>

<p>GTK Sudoku is built using the GNU Build Tools, and about all you have to
do to make your system aware of GTK+ is add the following to your
<code>configure.ac</code> file</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>AM_PATH_GTK_2_0(2.8.0,, [AC_MSG_ERROR([Cannot find GTK+])])</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and <code>@GTK_CFLAGS@</code> and <code>@GTK_LIBS@</code> to your
<code>Makefile.am</code>.</p>

<p>The use of the GNU Build Tools made it trivial to move GTK Sudoku to
different GNU/Linux distributions, and an Intel Mac. On the Mac, I installed
the version of X11 that came with the machine, and used DarwinPorts to install
gtk2. GTK Sudoku then builds as it does on GNU/Linux. Writing ones own
portfile is also quite easy. In addition to filling in the required fields,
one only need add:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>depends_lib              port:gtk2</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Porting GTK Sudoku to Windows was challenging. Creating a GTK+ development
environment on top of <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> and MSYS is quite
different that doing so for the other GUI frameworks I have used. For
example, with FLTK, one can download the sources, and easily build and
install the framework. Being able to build from the sources allows you
to statically link your application, easing deployment.</p>

<p>GTK+ depends on a number of packages that are not part of the standard
MinGW or MSYS runtime environment. Assembling a development environment from
precompiled binaries is painful enough to cause one to avoid using the
sources. Additionally, there are technical reasons that make it very
difficult to build an environment that allows static linking of GTK+
applications. As a result, many developers simply download the collection of
archives made available by Tor Lillqvist. This distribution is of great use
to newcomers, and is something I am thankful for. There are, however,
challenges to be overcome when using this distribution.</p>

<p>The use of the GNU Build Tools made it trivial to move GTK Sudoku
on non-Windows platforms, but on Windows, it was more difficult a GTK+
application than it is to move an FLTK or wxWindows application. If
you follow the recommendations in the FLTK and wxWidgets
documentation, your build system will work unmodified on all systems,
including MSYS. On only MSYS, the link command requires the
<code>-mwindows</code> option, which is added by the GUI framework's
configure script; however, the GTK+ configure script omits the
<code>-mwindows</code> option on MSYS.  I dealt with this problem by
simply adding the flag to my local copy of
<code>/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/gdk-2.0.pc</code>.</p>

<p>Packaging GTK Sudoku for Windows was the real challenge. For Windows,
there is an installer for GTK+ version 2.8.18, which places a collection of
DLLs and support files in <code>C:\Program Files\Common Files\GTK\2.0</code>.
The current Windows development environment provides version 2.8.20. It turns
out you can run a GTK Sudoku binary created with GTK+ 2.8.20 using a GTK+
2.8.18 runtime if you add to your source file a definition of the function
<code>g_type_register_static_simple</code>, a function added to GTK+ after
version 2.8.18. What a hack, no?</p>

<p>The GTK Sudoku Windows installer is close to the <a href="http://luaforge.net/">LuaForge</a> 10MB limit in file size. This
is because I had to include all the files in the GTK+ 2.8.18 installer
into the GTK Sudoku installer. If you install GTK+ 2.8.18 into the
Common File area, applications such as GAIM stop working.</p>

<p>Once you decide place the runtime in your installer, you can change
its components.  Tor Lillqvist tells me the better solution to my
runtime linking problem would have been to update its version of
GLib to 2.12.</p>

<p>In summary, I was very impressed with GTK+, and especially with Cairo;
however, porting the GTK+ application to Windows proved challenging, but not
insurmountable.</p>
