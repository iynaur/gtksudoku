GTK Sudoku: A Logic Puzzle Solving Aid

A Sodoku logic puzzle is solved by filling each cell in a board so
that every row, column, and 3x3 square contains the digits one through
nine.  This program eliminates much of the drudgery of solving a
puzzle and provides educational tips should the path to the solution
become obscured.  It is different from most other programs in this
category, because users specify the rule that justifies each change to
the Sudoku board.  The program will fail to apply a rule if its
preconditions are not met, thus detecting silly mistakes early.

This program requires GTK+ 2.0 version 2.8.0 or higher.

MinGW/MSYS Build Tips

Install GTK+ DLLs and development files into /local, not / as MSYS
handles files in /bin specially.

On MSYS, pkg-config fails to include the -mwindows option in its
linker output, unlike fltk-config and wx-config.  To repair the
problem, add -mwindows to the Libs: field in the GTK+ 2.0 pkg-config
configuration file.

/local/lib/pkgconfig/gtk+-2.0.pc:
--------------------------------------
Libs: ... -mwindows
