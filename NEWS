GTK Sudoku NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

   result.

* Changes in 0.5

** History mechanism was revamped.

*** Pop command was renamed to back.

*** New command: new, which creates a blank board.

*** New command: swap, which swaps the current board with the one most
recently saved.

*** All other history commands have been purged.

* Changes in 0.4

** This version corrects a printing bug exercised when an inconsistent
board is created.  Inconsistent boards occur when one uses trial and
error to solve a puzzle.

* Changes in 0.3

** Advanced strategies and some pair strategies used to determine cells
that had only one possible value (singletons) as a result of applying
the strategy.  In this version, these strategies only perform one
step, and users must identify cells determined by these strategies.

** The propagate all singletons (p) command now ensures no singletons
are left after it is applied.

** The "help details", "help normal", and "index" commands now work as
expected.  In previous versions, the commands were not recognized.

* Changes in 0.2
